# Woff Woff

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as Woff2 files.

## Font license

In each font folder there is a license file. In general the licenses are
[SIL](https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1) or
[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## That is why we only share Woff2 file

There are many font formats for example TTF, SVG and Woff. Woff2 is a new
version of Woff, which is a compressed font format. It's also supported by all
major browsers. Safari is the most recent browser to support Woff2 and it has
been [supported in Safari](https://caniuse.com/woff2) since 2018.

## GDPR and self hosted fonts

More and more sites are moving away from Google Fonts because of the GDPR law.
Instead of using a CDN you probably should host the fonts yourself.

> The German court has ruled last month that Google Fonts is not in compliance
> with GDPR.
